# Emulated_NDN_Testbed_in_ONL

This repo contains several examples of an emulated NDN Testbed in ONL.
These examples come in different sizes to make it easier for beginners to
try it out:

Eastern_US_Only: contains just the gateway routers from the Eastern US (NEU, Michigan, Illinois, WU, Memphis and NIST)
US_Only: contains just the gateway routers from the US
Full_Testbed: contains the full NDN Testbed.

Each example contains its own ONL RLI topology file and Ansible configuration files.

More description and documentation is coming soon.
