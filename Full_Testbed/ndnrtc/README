hi John,

I’ve been checking that I got all the required files together in one package so that you can start experimenting with the binary.
Few notes,

-- since the binary is dependent on several shared libraries, I placed them in the archive. All you need to do - is to copy them to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
  -- make sure that there are no missing dependencies, one can do that by executing command “$ ldd ndnrtc-client” - this will show whether all shared dependencies resolved
- there are two sample videos (.argb) files
- there are two sample config files for headless app - sample-producer.cfg and sample-consumer.cfg; in param.cfg one can a sample structure of a config file with additional comments
- in order to support verification, one has to provide config policy file, it’s included - rule.conf; this file relies on file-based certificate as a trust anchor, so make sure you dumped certificate in a file ($ ndnsec-dump <cert-name> > signing.cert)
- to start client, execute the following command:

$ ./ndnrtc-client -c sample-producer.cfg -p rule.conf -t 30 -s <signing identity name>

this will run producer configured from sample-producer.cfg for 30 seconds;
likewise,

$ ./ndnrtc-client -c sample-consumer.cfg -p rule.conf -t 30 -s <signing identity name>

will run a consumer for 30 seconds. You should be able to see consumer logs and statistics files in /tmp directory.

I might’ve missed something here, so please let me know if you have questions. For efficiency, might want to setup a quick call and I’ll walk you over the whole setup process and help troubleshooting.

Thanks,
