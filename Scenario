Once RLI is done:
in an onlusr window:
> cd Emulated_NDN_Testbed_in_ONL/configuration
> ./runAll.sh

Once that is done:
cd Emulated_NDN_Testbed_in_ONL/Demo_Files
./populateVMs.sh

./runTrafficServer.sh &
./runTrafficClient.sh &

Check monitoring windows to make sure you see adequate traffic.

Then:

cd Emulated_NDN_Testbed_in_ONL/Demo_Files
./flipFlopNlsr.sh
